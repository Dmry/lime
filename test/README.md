## Unit testing

Unit testing is currently mostly limited to validation testing. Generated results will be compared to known (literature) data and the test framework will error when errors exceed 8%. This number was chosen on the basis of the distance between the opposing sides of the curve in the prints. Data was digitized using [WebPlotdigitizer](https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/).
